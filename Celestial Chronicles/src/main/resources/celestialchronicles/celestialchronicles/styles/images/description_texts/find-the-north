Finding north using constellations is a traditional method
for navigation that has been used for centuries. Here's a
simple guide to finding north using two well-known
constellations:

Locate the Big Dipper (Ursa Major):

Look for the Big Dipper, which is one of the most
recognizable star patterns in the northern hemisphere.
It looks like a ladle or a saucepan.
Find the two stars at the end of the Big Dipper's bowl
that are farthest from the handle. These stars are called
"Dubhe" and "Merak."
Draw an imaginary line through these two stars and extend
it outwards. This line will point towards the North Star.

Find the North Star (Polaris):

Once you have identified the two stars at the end of
the Big Dipper's bowl, continue along the line they form
for about five times the distance between them.
You will find a moderately bright star at the end of this
line. This is the North Star, also known as Polaris.
Polaris appears almost stationary in the night sky because
it is located nearly above the Earth's North Pole. Therefore,
it serves as a reliable marker for finding north.
