A Counter-Clockwise Star Clock

1. Find the Big Dipper and the North Star.
2. Picture a clock with the North Star at its center, and draw an
imaginary line starting from the North Star through the 2 pointer
stars of the Big Dipper—Dubhe and Merak. Assume that this is the hour
hand of your imaginary star clock.
3. The clock you just created in the sky is a 24-hour clock. Unlike on
a regular analog clock face where an hour takes up 30 degrees of a full
circle, the imaginary hour hand on the star clock moves only 15 degrees
per hour. What's more, this hour hand moves counter-clockwise.
4. Draw another imaginary line straight up from the North Star. This line
will mark midnight or the passing of 24 hours.

Calculating Time

To tell time, look at where the hour hand points to in relation to the
reference line.
Now, look at the calendar for the date. If it is March 6, you do not need
to do any calculations. The time on your imaginary clock will be the
actual time. For example, if the pointer hour hand points straight
to the top of the imaginary clock, the time will be midnight. If it
points 30 degrees to the right of the reference line, the time would be
22:00 or 10 pm.
To calculate times for different months, you will need to do the
following calculation:
Time = Dipper Time – 2 X (the number of months since March 6).
The time you get will be a rough estimate and may be off by about 30
minutes as compared to a clock.
To account for Daylight Saving Time (DST), add 1 hour to the
calculation in the months that DST is in place at your location.
