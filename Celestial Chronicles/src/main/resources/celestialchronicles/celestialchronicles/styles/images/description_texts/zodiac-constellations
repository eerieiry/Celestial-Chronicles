Know the Zodiac Constellations: There are twelve
zodiac constellations, each associated with a
specific period of the year. The zodiac
constellations are:

Understand the Zodiac Cycle: The zodiac cycle
begins with Aries and progresses through each
constellation until it reaches Pisces, completing
the cycle. Each zodiac constellation corresponds
roughly to a one-month period.

Observe the Night Sky: Look for the zodiac constellation
that is visible in the night sky. Zodiac constellations
are generally located along the ecliptic, which is the
apparent path of the Sun across the sky. This means that
the zodiac constellation visible at night depends on the
time of year and the position of the Sun.

Determine the Month: Based on the zodiac constellation
visible in the night sky, you can determine the
approximate month. For example:

If you see Taurus in the night sky, it's likely April or May.
If you see Leo, it's likely July or August.
If you see Sagittarius, it's likely November or December.
Consider the Time of Night and Location: The visibility of
zodiac constellations may vary depending on the time of night
and your location on Earth. Some constellations may only be
visible during certain months or from specific latitudes.
