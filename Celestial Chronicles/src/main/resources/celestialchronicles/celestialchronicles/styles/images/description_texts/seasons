Detecting seasons by observing Ursa Major (the Big Dipper)
involves tracking its position in the night sky throughout
the year.

Observe Ursa Major's Position in the Sky:

Throughout the year, Ursa Major will appear to move across
the sky. In the Northern Hemisphere, during the spring and
summer months, Ursa Major will be higher in the sky during
the evening hours, while during the fall and winter months,
it will be lower in the sky.

Track the Dipper's Orientation: Pay attention to the orientation
of the Big Dipper's handle. In the Northern Hemisphere, during
the spring and summer, the Big Dipper will appear "right-side up"
or upright in the evening sky. In contrast, during the fall and
winter, it will appear "upside down" or inverted in the evening sky.

Seasonal Changes in Ursa Major's Position: As the Earth orbits
the Sun, the position of Ursa Major in the sky changes gradually
over time. For example:

In spring, the Big Dipper will be high in the northeastern sky
during the early evening.
In summer, it will be high in the northern sky, often directly
overhead in the late evening.
In fall, it will be lower in the northwestern sky during the early
evening.
In winter, it will be low in the northern sky, closer to the horizon,
during the early evening.
